Module 19 Challenge

A nonprofit called Alphabet Soup is looking to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if they receive funding from the organization. A dataset of more than 34,000 organizations who have received funding from Alphabet Soup is used to build the model. This dataset contains information on: identification for each applicant, application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, organization type, active status, income classification, special considerations, funding amount requested, and whether money was used effectively.
