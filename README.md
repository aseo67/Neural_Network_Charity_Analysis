## Overview of Analysis
A nonprofit called Alphabet Soup is looking to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if they receive funding from the organization. A dataset of more than 34,000 organizations who have received funding from Alphabet Soup is used to build the model. This dataset contains information on: identification for each applicant, application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, organization type, active status, income classification, special considerations, funding amount requested, and whether money was used effectively. Using these variables, the following analysis explores a deep learning model that can help determine whether applicants will be successful with Alphabet Soup's funding. 


## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- _What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?_
  - asdf
- _What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?_
  - asdf
- _What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?_
  - asdf

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- _How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?_
  - asdf
- _Were you able to achieve the target model performance?_
  - asdf
- _What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?_
  - asdf


## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
